# Websites-response-time-tracking


## Summary
This is a web application that tests and records the response times of a list of common websites, 
namely "google.com", "facebook.com", "twitter.com", "cnet.com", and "amazon.com". 
The backend of the application executes HTTP requests to these websites, 
saves the results to a PostgreSQL database, and exposes the data through a REST API endpoint. 
The frontend displays a linear graph with the response times of each website over time, with the option to start or stop the tests.

The application is implemented using ReactJS on the frontend and any backend technology or framework of your choice. 
It is efficient and supports multiple users simultaneously. 
The data is saved and available when closing the browser and reopening the app. 
The application allows you to use any external library of your choice.
